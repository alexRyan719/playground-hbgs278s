# Comments
   
   Comments are very useful in programming. If you're coding for work or to be published, you'll want to explain your code with comments. You can also use
   comments in debugging to investigate your code further.  
    
    # This is a single line comment. Any line that starts with a # will be seen as a comment by the compiler / interpreter / computer. 
    
    '''
    This
    is
    a
    multi
    line
    comment
    '''

    """
    This
    is
    also
    a 
    multi
    line
    comment
    """
    
    # It gets a weird value here, still not sure why?
