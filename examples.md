# Loop Examples

It's helpful to see a few of the ways we would want to use these concepts. 

So, this bit of code here:

@[This is written out, verbatum, what is going on in loop logic]({"stubs": ["py_files/loop_example.py"], "command": "python3 py_files/loop_example.py"})


Can be simplified with using loops, like so:

@[This is written out, verbatum, what is going on in loop logic]({"stubs": ["py_files/loop_example_2.py"], "command": "python3 py_files/loop_example_2.py"})
