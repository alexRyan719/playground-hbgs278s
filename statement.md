# Intro

Hello and welcome to Beginner Python Concepts! Before we get started with actual Python code, it's important to understand what programming is all about.

# Simple Machines

Now, computers are very complex, but the way they operate is about as simple as you can get. They deal in 0s and 1s, and they only do exactly what they're told
to. There is no thinking / interpreting / assuming with computers. If you make a mistake, the computer will still follow your poorly written instructions. 

# Some Perspective

Think about any mundane task. This could be going upstairs, making a peanut butter & jelly sandwich, or even driving to the post office. When you describe how to
do these tasks to other people, you can skip over what we consider "common sense." If your bathroom is upstairs and your guest asks to use it, you just tell them
it's upstairs. Maybe you tell them to jiggle the toilet handle if it sticks or it's the second door on the right. However, you don't have to tell them things
like "watch out for my dog" or "you might have to open the bathroom door if it's closed."
