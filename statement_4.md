# Control Flow
  Control Flow refers to the use of comparison logic to determine what to do next. By that, I mean using if, elif, else statements to filter what code to run based on
  certain conditions. 

@[The test cases provided test some of the common "corner cases" you may want to test.]({"stubs": ["control_flow.py"], "command": "python3 control_flow.py"})


If and elif statements will execute if the expression equates to True or 1. If the expression evaluates down to any other value, the attached code won't execute.
