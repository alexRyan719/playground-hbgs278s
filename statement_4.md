# Control Flow
  Control Flow refers to the use of comparison logic to determine what to do next. By that, I mean using if, elif, else statements to filter what code to run based on
  certain conditions. 



If and elif statements will execute if the expression equates to True or 1. If the expression evaluates down to any other value, the attached code won't execute. 
    
@[Here are some examples of such:]({"stubs": ["py_files/control_flow_2.py"], "command": "python3 py_files/control_flow_2.py"})

You can also chain conditions in your if, elif, else statement blocks. This can be done with and, or, not, and xor. 

@[Try changing the conditions]({"stubs": ["py_files/control_flow_3.py"], "command": "python3 py_files/control_flow_3.py"})
