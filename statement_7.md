# Data Structures

  Data structures are objects, which means they are more complex variables. All objects can technically be considered data strucures, as they can hold more data than
  primitive variable. However, most Computer Scientist are referring to objects like Lists / Arrays, Dictionaries, Trees, Graphs, Etc when discussing data structures.
  
  Arrays are groups of primitive variables all stored together. In Python, we refer to these as lists. Here are a couple of examples of lists:
  
    example_list = []
    
    example_list_2 = [1,2,3]
    
    example_list_3 = ['a','b','c']
    
    example_list_4 = [1, 'b', 3]
