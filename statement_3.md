# Primitive Variables
   
   Primitive Variables are simple, single value variables used in computing. Think of them as shipping boxes to contain data. You need the right type of shipping
   box / container for different types of data. 
    
    
   Now, with Python, it's harder to see what type a variable is. Python does not require you to declare the type of variable when declaring Primitive variables 
   (as opposed to objects). 
   
  
   <ul>
   <li>Strings / Arrays of Chars = "Hello World!" / "This is also a string" / Any group of characters contained in single ('') or double ("") quotes</li>
   <li>Chars / Characters = 'a', 'b', 'Z', '!' / Any single letter or character. Can be in single or double quotes (for Python, not necessarily other languages)
   <li>Ints / Integers = 5 / 4 / 5,000,000 / any whole number</li>
   <li>Float / Floating Point = 10.0</li>
   <li>Bool / Boolean = True / False</li>
   </ul>
  
# To see what type your variable is, use the built-in type() function.

    example_string = "Hello World!"
    example_char = 'a'
    example_int = 5
    example_float = 10.0
    example_boolean = True
    
    print(type(example_string)
    print(type(example_char)
    print(type(example_int)
    print(type(example_float)
    print(type(example_boolean)
