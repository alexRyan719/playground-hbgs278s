# Primitive Variables
    # Primitive Variables are simple, single value variables used in computing. Think of them as shipping boxes to contain data. You need the right type of shipping
    # box / container for different types of data. 
  
    # Now, with Python, it's harder to see what type a variable is. Python does not require you to declare the type of variable when declaring Primitive variables 
    # (as opposed to objects). 
  
  
    <ul>
    <li>example_string = "Hello World!"</li>
    <li>example_int = 5</li>
    <li>example_float = 10.0</li>
    <li>example_boolean = True</li>
    </ul>
