    The order of operations is important for a few reasons. First, you should be using the correct order of operations to adhere to the standard that the rest
    of the world is (hopefully) following. That not only benefits others trying to use your code / logic / work, but also to you by saving your time on guesswork.
    If you don't need to worry about if you're doing the steps in the same order as others, then you can focus on other reasons your coding isn't working as expected.
