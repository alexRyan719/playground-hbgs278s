# Debugging

One of the most frustrating things about learning a new coding language is the debugging. Debugging is the removal of flaws (bugs) in your code. There are a 
couple ways to categorize bugs. 
    
# Syntax Errors

The more obvious bugs are known as Syntax Errors. These happen whenever you misspell something or leave something out. 




# Logic Errors

Another type of bug is a Logic Error. These are harder to detect as they don't usually affect your code being able to run. These errors are more with your 
process for the task you're trying to do (aka algorithm).

    The order of operations is important for a few reasons. First, you should be using the correct order of operations to adhere to the standard that the rest
    of the world is (hopefully) following. That not only benefits others trying to use your code / logic / work, but also to you by saving your time on guesswork.
    If you don't need to worry about if you're doing the steps in the same order as others, then you can focus on other reasons your coding isn't working as expected.
